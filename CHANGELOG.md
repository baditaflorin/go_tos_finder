All notable changes to this service are recorded here, newest first.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-07-29

### Fixed (real production false negatives, found via a live 1000-domain sample)

- **Homepage bot-block / WAF-challenge false negative.** The homepage fetch
  only treated HTTP >=500 as an error; a Cloudflare "Just a moment..." JS
  challenge, a stock Apache/Nginx 403 stub, or a generic WAF "Access Denied"
  page all return HTTP 200/403 with a real (non-empty) body, so the
  interstitial was fed straight into link scanning — which correctly found
  zero legal-document links in it — and the target was recorded as
  verdict:"none", indistinguishable from a domain that genuinely has no legal
  pages. A live re-fetch of 202 real "no_data" production domains found 15
  (~7%) were actually bot-blocked, not policy-free. New `isHomepageBlocked`
  (patterns_block.go) recognises the closed set of real interstitial
  signatures observed and reports these honestly as `status:"blocked"` /
  `result:"error"` / `verdict:"unknown"` (HTTP 502) instead of a false
  no-data claim.
- **Non-UTF-8 charset corruption.** Response bodies were read as raw bytes
  and treated as UTF-8 everywhere (every pattern regex, and encoding/json on
  the way out), with no charset detection at all. Real sites in production
  still declare `charset=iso-8859-1` / `windows-1252` (older European sites)
  or Shift_JIS/EUC-KR/GBK (older Japanese/Korean/Chinese sites); reading those
  bytes as UTF-8 silently breaks every non-ASCII title/link-text match,
  including the CJK/Cyrillic/Greek/Arabic script matchers added specifically
  for geo coverage. `decodeToUTF8` (charset.go) now transcodes to UTF-8 when
  the origin explicitly declares (and `golang.org/x/net/html/charset` is
  *certain* of) a non-UTF-8 encoding; an undeclared/ambiguous body is left
  byte-for-byte unchanged, so this cannot introduce new corruption on
  already-UTF-8 pages.
- **German "Datenschutzerklärung" title under-scored.** The privacy-policy
  `titleRegex` and canonical-probe false-positive guard matched bare
  `\bdatenschutz\b`, which cannot match inside the standard German compound
  title "Datenschutzerklärung" (no word boundary mid-compound). A real German
  privacy page titled exactly this way — even with a perfectly UTF-8 body —
  fell through to low/medium confidence, and could be rejected outright by
  the canonical-probe FP guard if the body used only German legal vocabulary.
  Found while writing the charset-fix test fixture; fixed independently of
  encoding in both `patterns.go` and `verify.go`.

## 1.3.5 — 2026-07-17

### Changed
- Make ToS finder selftest deterministic
- fix: reject third-party and soft-404 legal docs
- fix: reduce detector false positives

## 1.3.4 — 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- Retry the pre-fetch SSRF/DNS reachability check (safehttp.CheckURL) once on a transient DNS lookup timeout, mirroring the existing homepage-fetch retry. Live domains (including stripe.com/github.com) were intermittently failing this single-shot 3s DNS check and getting permanently recorded as unreachable.
